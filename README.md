 # HR Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing HR data to understand and predict employee attrition. The process involves cleaning the dataset, visualizing the data, and building a predictive model.

## Files

- `hr-analysis-streamlit.py`: Streamlit app built to show visualization.
- `HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`: Dataset containing HR data.
- `HR_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis (optional).
- `hr_analysis.py`: Script for easier execution.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Make sure you have Python installed.
   - Install the required libraries by running:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Analysis Script**:
   - Clean the dataset and visualize the data:
     ```bash
     python hr_analysis.py
     ```
   - Follow the script to proceed with model building and attrition prediction.

3. **Interactive Analysis (Optional)**:
   - If you prefer an interactive environment, open the `HR_Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - The script starts by cleaning the dataset, renaming columns to allow for easier readability, and ensuring data consistency.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Visualizations are created to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
